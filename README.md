# SDLGame
It's finally here. The new and improved version of SDLGame.
Introducing
SDLGame V2!!!!
This has a complete re-write of the code (still in development) for now you can play around with the textures!
# Compiling
You can compile using g++ or gcc but using Visual Studio would be better (This was written using Visual Studio Preview 2022) also you have to get SDL2 and SDL2_image by yourself and also you must copy all the DLLs from SDL2 and SDL2_image to the root of the project
# Running
Grab yourself an installer from releases and have fun!

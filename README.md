# SDLGame Project
How u doin!? So I decided to make a SDLGame which just displays some grass blocks and no controls. Remember im gonna have to wait until codergopher updates his SDL2 tutorial
So to install the game ~~(only on linux sorry windows users)~~
NOT TRUE I FOUND OUT MY CODE WORKS ON WINDOWS JUST USE WINDOWS 7 IF U DONT HAVE WINDOWS 7 AND UR USING WINDOWS 10 USE WSL AND FOLLOW LINUX STEPS WINDOWS 7 WILL BE LINKED [HERE](https://github.com/hdfsyu/SDLGame-windows)
Install libsdl2-dev, libsdl2-2.0-0, libsdl2-image-dev, libsdl2-mixer-dev, libsdl2-ttf-dev.
And type this command (in the root of SDLGame):
`make`
That will compile everything and run the game when u close the game copy the res folder to /bin/debug/ NOT RELEASE!
# Running
just go to the bin/debug folder and type `./main`
PLEASE DO NOT EDIT ANY FILES.

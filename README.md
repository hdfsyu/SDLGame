# SDLGame Project
How u doin!? So I decided to make a SDLGame which just displays some grass blocks and no controls. Remember im gonna have to wait until codergopher updates his SDL2 tutorial
So to install the game ~~(only on linux sorry windows users)~~
NOT TRUE I FOUND OUT MY CODE WORKS ON WINDOWS JUST USE WINDOWS 7 IF U DONT HAVE WINDOWS 7 AND UR USING WINDOWS 10 USE WSL AND FOLLOW LINUX STEPS.
Install libsdl2-dev, libsdl2-2.0-0, libsdl2-image-dev, libsdl2-mixer-dev, libsdl2-ttf-dev. On windows: Install SDL2, SDL2_MIXER, SDL2_IMAGE and SDL2_TTF.
And type this command (in the root of SDLGame):
`make`
That will compile everything and run the game when u close the game copy the res folder to /bin/debug/ NOT RELEASE!
# Running
just go to the bin/debug folder and type `./main` on windows its gonna be `main.exe`
PLEASE DO NOT EDIT ANY FILES.
# Running 2
I found out my code is compatible with EmScripten...
To compile it with emscripten instead of make run:
`make emcc`
in the root of the project (its the same command for all operating systems)
To play it (without doing crazy stuff go [here](https://hdfsyu.itch.io/sdlgame) and then go to the description of the page.
# Running 3
To run it on windows run:
`make win`
in the root of the project

# SDLGame
It's finally here. The new and improved version of SDLGame.
Introducing
SDLGame V2!!!!
This has a complete re-write of the code (still in development) for now you can play around with the textures!
# Compiling
You can compile using g++ or gcc but using Visual Studio would be better (This was written using Visual Studio Preview 2022) also you have to get SDL2 and SDL2_image by yourself and also you must copy all the DLLs from SDL2 and SDL2_image to the root of the project
# Running
Use the Local Windows Debugger in visual studio, not really that hard or just grab the zip file from releases and run it, also if you are on macOS or Linux then try using wine, if wine doesn't work report it in Issues!

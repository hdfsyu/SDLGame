# SDLGame Project
How u doin!? So I decided to make a SDLGame which just displays some grass blocks and no controls. Remember im gonna have to wait until codergopher updates his SDL2 tutorial
So to install the game (only on linux sorry windows users)
Install libsdl2-dev, libsdl2-2.0-0, libsdl2-image-dev, libsdl2-mixer-dev, libsdl2-ttf-dev.
And type this command (in the root of SDLGame):
`make`
That will compile everything and run the game when u close the game copy the res folder to /bin/debug/ NOT RELEASE!
# Running
just go to the bin/debug folder and type `./main`
PLEASE DO NOT EDIT ANY FILES.
alr **bai**

# SDLGame
It's finally here. The new and improved version of SDLGame.
Introducing
SDLGame V2!!!!
This has a complete re-write of the code (still in development) for now you can play around with the textures!
# Compiling
You can compile using g++ or gcc but using Visual Studio would be better (This was written using Visual Studio Preview 2022)
# Running
Grab yourself an installer from releases and have fun!
